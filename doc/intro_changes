   The provided function names are automatically generated by ledisasm.
   Addresses are run-time in-memory.

   I assume that all C library functions have been identified and ported.

1. func_01944 at 0x000e1030 is GRIP.GLL initialization - ret it out

2. func_01873 at 0x000dca68 - ret it out

3. func_01868 at 0x000dc6a0 and func_01869 at 0x000dc728 are allocators,
   modify them so that they return zeroed blocks of memory (calloc) unless
   the argument is -1, then return 0

   func_01871 at 0x000dc8b8 appears to be a free()

4. func_02164 at 0x000eee84 (XXX - what does it do?) make it return 1

5. func_02125 at 0x000ed4f0 is
   int
   set_video_mode(uint16_t mode_index, uint32_t width, uint32_t height,
                  const uint8_t *palette)
		  
   mode_index is the index in the table which starts at about data_00463 at
   0x00155d74 to a structure which contains width, height, bpp and some
   other stuff

   This function sets the following static variables:
   uint32_t data_04487 at 0x001e2e74 which is screen_width
   uint32_t data_04488 at 0x001e2e78 which is screen_height
   uint16_t data_04506 at 0x001e2eb8 which is mode_index
   void *data_04479 at 0x001e2e54 which is screen_buffer

   returns 1 on success, -1 on error (XXX: double check)

6. func_02151 at 0x000ee8a4 is
   int
   set_palette(uint8_t *palette)

   where palette is a table of 256 consecutive RGB bytes where each byte
   contains a value of 0-63 (needs to be multiplied by 4 to get full range)

   returns 1 on success (XXX: double check)

7. func_01108 at 0x0008c510 (XXX: check it)
   This one sets up some interrupt handlers.
   For now make it return 1.

8. func_02058 at 0x000e926c (XXX: check it)
   Don't know what it does.
   Ret it out.

9. func_00286 at 0x000353ec initialises sound - ret it out for now

10. func_02741 at 0x0010f110 runs a timer... zzzz

11. in func_02741 at 0x0010f110 and func_02743 at 0x0010f160 there is a
    reference to the address 0x46c which is the bios timer which increments
    by default every (XXX Ralph).  Replace that with getting the current
    milliseconds times 1193.  Also, the IO ports 0x34 and 0x40 used in
    func_02741 are used for timer setup, they can be reted out.

12. func_02760 is an open wrapper, it should just call
    dos_open([esp+0x4], [esp+0xc]) and return what it returns.

13. func_02761 at 0x0010fd69 is a bit tricky.  It is
    void func_02761(int fd, void *buffer, uint16_t ds, size_t count,
                    size_t *ret).
    Even though it is cdecl, it preserves ebx, edx and ecx.  It does a
    simple read and saves the bytes read in *ret.  It is a good candidate to
    flip buffers in.  It needs to be modified so that it works.

14. func_02790 at 0x00110feb - dunno what it does, ret it out
    XXX - not really necessary ?

15. func_02132 at 0x000ee1c0 - dunno what it does, ret it out

The intro should play now!
